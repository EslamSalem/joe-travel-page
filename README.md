# Joe's Travel Page ðŸŒŠ
I made this website following Academind's course on web development.
The purpose of this site was for me to apply my newly gained knowledge of element positioning
and general layout of the page. The website was made using HTML and CSS.
# Overview
The home page consists of a header that includes the logo of the site and it also acts as a home button
to return you to the main page, and a couple of navigation buttons that take you to different pages of the site.
The background image was loaded by CSS and the main section of the body was placed behind the header by manipulating
the header's position property. Lastly, there is a card in the center of the screen with the Title, a little caption,
and a button that takes you to the places page.

The second half of the home page includes a list of images, and their corresponding captions, aligned with Flexbox.
And a footer at the end of the page with links to Instagram and Facebook.

The second page includes the same header and footer. So the two pages share a CSS file to prevent redundant code.
This page consists of a list of cards aligned with Grid.
Each card contains an image of a place, some dummy text resembling a description of the place,
and a link to the wikipedia page of that place.
